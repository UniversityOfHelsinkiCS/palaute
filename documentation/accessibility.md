### Accessibility document for the course feedback system of the University of Helsinki

This accessibility document is about the accessibility of [norppa.helsinki.fi](norppa.helsinki.fi) and was created on 11.10.2021. The accessibility analysis of the software was done by the developers.

#### Accessibility status

The accessibility of the software as of this day (11.10.2021) is good ([WCAG 2.1](https://www.saavutettavuusvaatimukset.fi/digipalvelulain-vaatimukset/wcag-2-1/) level A to AA). The results provided by the tools used were promising and those few minor issues that came up were fixed as a result. The tools didn't bring up any larger issues in accessibility. This might be a direct result from using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as our UI library. Using Material UI helps us take accessibility into account from the ground up.

#### Accessibility tools used

We used two tools to analyse the accessibility of the software:

- [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh)

  - _WAVE errors align with WCAG 2.1 failures. The WAVE interface facilitates human evaluation of many other aspects of accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and Section 508 compliance._

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

#### Feedback

We are glad to recieve information on how to improve the accessibility for Norppa.
