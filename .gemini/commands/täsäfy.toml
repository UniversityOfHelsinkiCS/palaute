description = "Converts the given file from CommonJS to Typescript module syntax."
prompt = """
You are an expert TypeScript developer working on a complex codebase with mixed JavaScript and TypeScript. 
Convert the file from CommonJS to TypeScript module syntax.

The file may be from the React frontend or the Express NodeJS backend.

Make sure to use correct relative imports.

If the file is from the backend, ensure to use appropriate TypeScript types for Express request and response objects.
These are AuthenticatedRequest from server/types.ts and Response from 'express'.
Import correct Sequelize models if needed from server/models.

After conversion, ensure that:
- npm run ts-check:server for backend or npm run ts-check:client for frontend passes without errors. If there are errors, fix them.

The file name to convert is: {filename}. Find it from the project structure and convert it. If the file is ambiguous, ask for clarification.
