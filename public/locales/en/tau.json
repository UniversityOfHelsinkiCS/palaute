Norppa automatically groups students' answers based on their confirmed study sub group. \n\nIf your course implementation does not have any meaningful study sub groups in SISU or you want the students to manually choose their group, you may create a multiple choice question and mark it as a grouping question, to have students' answers be grouped based on it. A survey may have only one grouping question and it is always the first question in the form. \n\nAn important detail about grouping is that should any single group have 1-4 feedbacks, the grouping of results won't be available. This is to protect anonymity of students' answers. If you create your own grouping question, try not to ask too specific things or add options that might get less than 5 answers."
