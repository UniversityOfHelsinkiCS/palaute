A survey may have only one grouping question and it is alwaysthe first question in the form. \n\nAn important detail about grouping is thatshould any single group have 1-4 feedbacks, the grouping of results won't be available. This is to protect anonymity of students' answers. If you create your own grouping question, try not to ask too specific things or add options that might get less than 5 answers."
